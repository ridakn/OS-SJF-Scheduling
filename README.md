# OS-SJF-Scheduling

Program to implement SJF scheduling given burst and arrival times.

SJFSchedule.java: source code file

My implementation takes in user input or can read a file
5 sample test input txt files 
  Each file has one process per row, arrival time in the first column and burst time in the second column
  
4 sample output screenshots showing the program execution
  Two show user input implementation
